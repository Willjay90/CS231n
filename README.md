# CS231n 2017

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu) is a course that introduces **Convolutional Neural Network** for **Visual Recognition**.
I found this class very helpful in **machine learning**, especially **deep learning**. It introduces state-of-the-art technique in computer vision.


You will build up your own network from scratch with **Python** in the assignments.
Also, you will be working in either [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks.

There is another **Machine Learning** course I **HIGHLY** recommend 👍 

**[Intro to machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)** on Udacity, lectured by Sebastian Thrun and Katie Malone.
